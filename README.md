Analyze the relationship between temperature and revenue using Linear Regression to predict revenue based on temperature

**Dataset Description**: a dataset called “IceCreamData.csv” containing information about temperature and revenue. Each row represents a sample, and the columns are as follows:

**Temperature:** The temperature (Celsius).
**Revenue:** The revenue (dollars) associated with that temperature.
Objective: The goal is to analyze the relationship between temperature and revenue. Specifically, understand how changes in temperature impact revenue.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): create histograms, pair plots, and joint plots to visualize the data. These visualizations help to explore patterns, correlations, and potential trends.

**Linear Regression:** You plan to use linear regression to predict revenue based on temperature. Linear regression models the relationship between a dependent variable (revenue) and one or more independent variables (temperature in this case).
